# Fish-And-Shark-Animation
This is a school project of 3D game design for fish and shark. In here I implemented the code from lab and wrote my potential function for objects when they interact with each other. And I customize some key interactions that players can add food to the tank, and the fish will come and eat them. Moreover, fish and shark will never go outside the tank given the functions I wrote. Also, I make the movements of the objects more realistic by adding their tail direction same as their moving direction, and their tails can go up and down constantly. It is a very fun project and I can't wait to do more similar things.
